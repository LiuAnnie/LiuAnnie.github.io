                    For my final project, I made an interactive website to control the speed
                    of the 3 servos in my light painting instrument. Access my presentation

                    My original plan was to make an interactive website that would control the
                    speed of the 3 servos and lighting. I wanted to replace the flashlight that I use
                    as a light source, with LED strips. This way, I would be able to program various
                    lighting effects and control light from all 4 sides of the instrument. Shown above
                    was my initial sketch for the website: a slider for speed and various buttons to
                    control lighting, including effects and light from each side. However,
                    upon further experimentation, I recognized that the results achieved from the
                    LED strips could not compare to those of the flashlight.

                    I also tested both flashlight + LED strips together,
                    and that worked alright. However, when I tested out various lighting effects by programming
                    the LED strips, I wasn't satisfied with how the light paintings turned out. Using the flashlight
                    alone seemed to produce the best light paintings.

                    I might want to control lighting from my website in the future. I thought of a machine that
                    I could attach the flashlight to and place on top of the instrument. This machine would
                    receive a signal from the web and move the flashlight to the desired spot over the
                    instrument's frame, using x and y position inputs.

                    <p></p>
                    Moving forward, the concept of my final project is to make an interactive website that will allow
                    me to control my light painting instrument from my computer. I wanted to be able to control
                    the speed of the 3 servos with a slider.
                    <p></p>
                    I first reprogrammed the instrument to meet the needs of this project. After making sure that
                    the instrument functioned as intended, I began building the interactive website. I explored
                    using buttons to change the speed of the servos, before I eventually went with a slider.
                    <p></p>
                    On the P5 side of the code, I created a slider that can have values 1 to 5 with 3 being the
                    default value. The value of the slider corresponds to the servos' speed settings, with 1 being
                    the slowest and 5 being the fastest. When the value of the slider changes, I send the updated
                    speed setting value through serial to the Arduino.
                    <p></p>
                    On the Arduino side of the code, the servos are told to continuously loop back and forth between positions
                    0 and 180. At the same time, the Arduino is constantly checking for new serial data. When it receives
                    a new speed setting value, each servo's assigned delays are reassigned to give it a new speed. When a '1'
                    comes through over serial, each servo's delay is set to 40 ms, and when a '5' comes through, each servo's
                    delay is set to 5 ms. The longer the delay, the slower the servo will move to its next position.
                    <p></p>
                    Pretty straightforward!

                    Calculations for current, resistance, and voltage weren't necessary
                    since the servo can be attached directly to the Arduino. I referenced this:
